This is the worst kind of discrimination there is: the kind against me!
I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
Hahahahaha. Oh wait you’re serious. Let me laugh even harder.
There. Now no one can say I don’t own John Larroquette’s spine.
I’ll build by own theme park. With black jack, and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
The game’s over. I have all the money. Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!
That’s closest thing to ‘Bender is great’ that anyone other me has ever said.
I’m Bender, baby! Oh god, please insert liquor!
Hey sexy mama, wanna kill all humans?
Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her, but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found.

Have you ever thought about turning off th TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Fry crack corn and I don't care, Leela crack corn and still don't care, Bender crack corn and he is great!! TAKE THAT YOU STUPID CORN!!!
Shut up baby I know it!
I'm sorry you struck out sausage link, but if it's any consolation, my life is great!
Some day we'll be able to look back on this whole thing and laugh...AH HA HA HA!!!!
Bite my shiny metal ass!
